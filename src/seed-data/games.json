        "summary": "Originating in the arcades, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.",

        "summary": "XMultiply is a side-scrolling shooter published by Irem, and similar in style to their earlier R-Type. In 1998, the game was released with Image Fight as a one-disc doublebill on PlayStation and Sega Saturn.\nThe game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249\u2014the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.\n\nImage Fight is a 1988 vertically scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game developed and published by Irem. The arcade game was also ported for the Nintendo Entertainment System, PC Engine (Japan-only), Sharp X68000 (Japan-only), and FM Towns (Japan-only) in 1990.\n\nThe player flies a futuristic red ship. R-Type Final identifies this ship as the OF-1 Daedalus, but it is not known if that was the ship's original name. However, the term OF-1 does appear in the NES version's instruction manual, as well as in the official artwork for the sequel, Image Fight II. The game appears to be set inside a holographic simulator, like the holodeck on Star Trek: The Next Generation. In the NES version of the game, the first 5 missions are called \"Combat Simulation Stages\" and the last 3 missions are called \"Real Combat Stages\".\n\nTwo separate titles on one very collectable compilation for the shooter fan. X Multiply is similar to Gradius with claustrophobic confines and organic add ons to the ship giving it floaty, stamen like guards. Image Fight is more a chunky R Type tribute with nice multi directional shots and an old school feel. The rarest of the Arcade Gears series.",

        "storyline": "Melody is a spirit who lives inside an enchanted music box, possessing the ability to see people\u2019s deepest and most secret wishes. With her talents, she can make them come true in the dream worlds she conjures.\n\nWhen Cornelius, a student of the Astral Academy, stumbles upon Melody\u2019s music box and opens it, he unleashes Melody, who decides to create fantastic new dreams for all the Academy's students. Luckily one student is able to escape the curse and summon the Heroes of Trine to set things right.\n\nThe heroes must traverse the dreamscapes of the Astral Academy, lush and verdant pirate adventures, face the night on the icy cold tundra, follow a sinister path through a haunted old forest, survive in the surreal world inside the clockwork mind of a mechanical owl, and finally solve all mysteries at the deceivingly cosy homestead of Cornelius Crownsteed.\n\nIn addition to the familiar faces of Heroes of Trine, Melody of Mystery reintroduces many fan favorites from Nine Parchments, a Trine universe spin-off story that focused on Astral Academy students. Cornelius is not the only student under Melody's spell - Carabel, Gislan, Rudolfus and Owl are all dreaming of enchanted fantasies.",
        "summary": "In Trine 4: Melody of Mystery, there's trouble brewing at the Astral Academy once again. All the students are cursed, trapped in enchanted slumber and unable to wake up. With a mysterious spirit on the loose, released accidentally by the kind and guileless Cornelius Crownsteed, it's best to call the Heroes of Trine to see what they can do to bring back Cornelius and his fellow students from their enticing dreamlands.\n\nTrine 4: Melody of Mystery is a 6-level story campaign that continues the travels of Amadeus, Pontius, and Zoya. The new adventure features more upgrades for the heroes' skills, and fresh puzzles with clever gameplay elements for our heroes to take on.",

        "summary": "In 1986, SSI published the next part of the series, Phantasie II. Again, the Dark Lord Nikademus was the nemesis. This time Nikademus had fashioned an evil orb, and with it he cast a curse on a beautiful island named Ferronrah and enslaved its people. The player's mission was to find and destroy the orb. \n \nPhantasie II used the same graphics and fighting as the original Phantasie game, with one improvement to combat: the ability of any character class to target any enemy rank with a thrown rock. There were improvements in the complexity of quests, but little was done to innovate the series. One option which endeared many veterans was the ability to transfer characters from Phantasie I to this sequel. \n \nThe manual included in Phantasie II was identical to the one included with Phantasie, plus a small card explaining the differences. Computer Gaming World noted this was advantageous in terms of how players of the original would have an easier time getting into the game, but disadvantageous as to some particularly tedious mechanisms of both games, particularly \"the infamous Distribution and Selling rigamarole.\" The review continued to note that characters imported from the original have their equipment removed as well as most of their gold and experience, affording only a slight head start over newly created characters.[",

Teams are individually rated from one to five in throwing, catching, dashing, and dodging abilities. Offbeat male and female characters of varying skill play for the Wild Cats, Pranksters, Heart Breakers, Ninjas, Snipers, Fireballs, Thunder Bolts, and Elementals.\n\nThe game follows the general rules of dodge ball, in that the object is to knock out the opposing members of a team within a time limit. Players with the ball can aim right, left, high, or low. Thrown balls can be caught by the opposing team, which awards them points. These points can then be used to implement special throws such as the grenade, boomerang, and the screwdriver, making the balls more difficult to avoid or catch. Options include adjustable time limits for Single Matches and three levels of difficulty.",

        "storyline": "Eons after the human civilization has crumbled upon itself, its nomadic descendants, known as the Legion of Man, are uncovering long-forgotten knowledge and technology. Devastating weapons help them fight a violent battle for their very existence, against a monstruous enemy, the Beast Horde. A race of beings evolved from the wildlife that survived the apocalyptic wars, they use brute force and the powerful magic of nature to punish the humans. \n \nSavage XR, the successor of the 2003 award winning PC game \"Savage: Battle for Newerth\", delivers a unique team-based gaming experience, defining a new genre: RTSS (Real Time Strategy Shooter). As a field player, you will master diverse weapons and units engaged in a fast paced battle. The FPS mode boasts a truly one-of-a-kind melee system, rewarding genuine player skill. In the RTS mode, as the commander of your team, you will manage your economy and resources, develop a robust tech tree, plan your assault and lead real human players to battle.",
        "summary": "Be a Commander or a Warror - RTS meets FPS \n \nSavage: The Battle for Newerth is a science fiction game released by S2 Games on September 9th, 2003. It was a first of its kind; described by S2 as a real-time-strategy-shooter (RTSS). It brought together real-time strategy, first-person shooting, and third-person melee action into one cohesive experience. Set in a distant future when mankind has rebuilt society following an apocalypse, but is threatened by intelligent beasts, players must choose a side, elect their commander (RTS), and go to war (FPS). In 2006 Savage became freeware and its source code was made available to the public. One year later, a handful of dedicated players and modders began work on Savage XR, a project intended to update and overhaul the original game. Now after seven years of development Savage XR is finished and available for free to the public. \n \nXR breathes new life into a game that has held its own for a decade. New features include: in game tutorials, duel practice mode against Python based AI-bots and game-play demos, 500 new props, wide screen support and alternative FOVs, triggers and particle effects, improved models and textures, physics engine supporting realistic collisions, unique items for all competitive clans, a simpler user-friendly installer and automatic game updater, and more. Savage XR is awesome and free!",

When close enough, a boxer can hit his opponent with a punch (executed by pressing the fire button on the Atari joystick). This causes his opponent to reel back slightly. Long punches score one point, while closer punches (power punches, from the manual) score two. There are no knockdowns or rounds. A match is completed either when one player lands 100 punches (a \"knockout\") or two minutes have elapsed (a \"decision\"). In the case of a decision, the player with the most landed punches is the winner. Ties are possible. \nWhile the gameplay is simple, there are subtleties, such as getting an opponent on the \"ropes\" and \"juggling\" him back and forth between alternate punches.",

America's Army represents the first large-scale use of game technology by the U.S. government as a platform for strategic communication and the first use of game technology in support of U.S. Army recruiting. \n \nThe America's Army concept was conceived in 1999 by Colonel Casey Wardynski; the Army's Chief Economist and Professor at the United States Military Academy.[2] Wardynski envisioned \"using computer game technology to provide the public a virtual Soldier experience that was engaging, informative and entertaining.\"[3] America's Army was managed by two other U.S. Army officers serving with Wardynski at the Office of Economic and Manpower Analysis (OEMA): Major Chris Chambers and Major Bret Wilson. \n \nThe Windows version 1.0, subtitled Recon, was first released on July 4, 2002. As of January 2014, there have been over 41 versions and updates released, including updates to America's Army: Proving Grounds which was released in August 2013. All versions have been developed on the Unreal Engine. The game is financed by the U.S. government and distributed by free download. \n \nAccording to game historian Carrie McLeroy America's Army has \"grown in ways its originators couldn't have imagined\".[3] Dozens of government training and simulation applications using the America's Army platform have been developed to train and educate U.S. Army soldiers.[4] America's Army has also been used to deliver virtual soldiering experiences to participants at events, such as air shows, amusement parks, and sporting events around the country. The America's Army series has also been expanded to include versions for Xbox and Xbox 360, arcade, and mobile applications published through licensing arrangements.[5][6]",

You alone survive. \n \nThe Shogun has taken possession of the Ninja Palace of Lin Fen and the sacred scrolls containing the ancient secrets of the Ninja. \n \nOnly you- the Last Ninja- can avenge the Brotherhood and recapture the secrets of the Ninja. \n \nYou must use all your fighting skills. Samurai warriors, masters of the martial arts, and the Shogun's guards lurk at every turn, ready to test their hand-to-hand combat skills against yours. \n \nYou must be as wise as you are strong. Find your way through a magnificent landscape that unfolds in screen after screen of unparalleled graphics- from the lavish interior of the Ninja Palace to the depths of its foulest dungeons. Scale forbidding mountains; cross lakes and rivers. Master new and dangerous tasks, like Ninja magic. Search for the hidden weapons, food, and charms that you need to win the final battle- and all the battles in between. \n \nThe way is long and dangerous. Start now. Kunitoki's warriors are already learning the Ninja ways.",

Test your skills in racing a million-dollar souped-up Freightliner in a 1st or 3rd person view. The game supports a variety of steering devices, though a simple keyboard will do. It features real truck racing teams and drivers, realistic damage, a replay editor, and an optional unlimited speed mode (trucks are normally limited to 160 km/h to minimize the damage these 5 tonners do when they spin out of control). Compete in a single race or full season mode on a number of licensed race tracks from around Europe, or practice all tracks with or without a Ghost truck.",

It supports EGA and CGA graphics.\n\nIn the game you play the magician Petton Everhail. At the start you are contacted by Terexin, High Wizard of the Kieralon who tells you how the Kieralon Empire has fallen. He convinces you to travel to the Kieralon Palace to collect his treasures and split them fifty-fifty.\n\nCatacomb consists of fifteen levels in the Apple II version, ten levels in the PC demo disk promoting Gamer's Edge, and 30 levels in the full PC version (The Catacomb, aka Catacomb II). To progress to the next level you must step through a magic teleportation mirror. These mirrors are usually behind a locked door, requiring you to obtain a key to advance.",

It's officially licensed through Electronic Arts (who had the license at the time) and is based on the 1999 Winston Cup series. There are three different race tracks to choose from each with a different difficulty level: Talladega Superspeedway, Richmond International Raceway and Watkins Glen International. A secret Team SEGA track exist too but it's not made available until 700 races have been made on the machine. Before racing the player can choose from real life cars and drivers that all have different strengths and weaknesses. The cars included are Pontiac Grand Prix, Ford Taurus, Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Firebird while there are more than 30 drivers to choose from.\n\nThe game can be played from a first person perspective or several different third person views. It's possible to choose automatic or manual transmission. The objective of the game is to race against the clock and reach a top three position and the finish line before the time runs out. By climbing up to a certain position the player can get a time extension. In time attack or multiplayer the player needs to finish a lap to get a time extension. A race ends when the time is up or if the player reaches the finish line. The multiplayer mode can be played by up to eight players.",

It is the third game in the Drift Out series, and was followed by Neo Drift Out: New Technology; unlike the previous Drift Out '94: The Hard Order, it resembles the first Drift Out and is sometimes referred to as a port or remake for that reason. \n \nAll races in this video game are based on the 1994 World Rally Championship season. Two different types of background music ('normal' and 'hard' beats) and three racing levels (easy, normal, and hard) are available. The top six times are tracked in each of the rally legs; including the super special stage. \n \nA North American release was planned by Accolade, though it was never released. The North American version would have featured fake manufacturer names.[5]",

        "storyline": "As a provincial governor charged with spreading the glory of Rome your mission is clear \u2013 build cities, foster trade and industry, make money. How you accomplish this is up to you. Gain wealth and power, make a career out of pleasing the emperor, battle barbarians and repel invaders, or concentrate on building the next Eternal City. Fail and you'll end up as lunch for the lions. Prove your strength of mind and spirit and you just might be crowned Caesar!\n\nTo help you achieve that goal you can ask your advisors for their insight or ask the people about their thoughts. You can also build temples and create festivals to please the gods and receive rewards or aid in return. You can choose between peaceful and military assignments to prove in various ways that you deserve the title of Caesar!",
        "summary": "Caesar III is part of Sierra's City Building Series and was released in October 1998. Cities in Caesar III try to accurately reflect the life of Roman citizens: the lowest plebians live in tents and shacks, while the richest patricians live in villas. Staple foods include wheat, fruits, vegetables, and pork, and wine is required for some festivals and houses. Citizens wander the streets in their various garbs and can tell the player their name and how they feel about the city. The city is viewed in a two dimensional isometric view with a fixed magnification level, and can be rotated ninety degrees.\nAccess to services such as market goods, entertainment, hygiene, education, and taxation are represented by \"walkers,\" which are people sent out from their buildings to patrol the streets. Any house that is passed by a walker is considered to have access to the services of the walker's building. All movements of goods and coverage of walkers are accurately reflected by citizens walking the streets: a player can watch a farm's crop progress, and when it's ready a worker will push a full cart from the farm to a nearby warehouse or granary; then return with an empty cart.\nBackground music is played which varies according to the situation (gentle themes to begin with, war drums during times of conflict and triumphal music when the player nears the objective). Musical themes are supplemented by crowd noises, the sounds of manufacturing and the clash of weapons at appropriate times.\nThere are two ways to play the game: Mission Mode, which is tantamount to typical \"campaign\" modes of other strategy games, and City Construction Mode, in which the player plays one scenario from scratch.",

In both modes, gamers can choose from one of three different boarder characters as they ride through the game's 27 different courses.

The game was originally published by Softdisk under the Gamer's Edge label, and is a first-person shooter with a dark fantasy setting. The player takes control of the high wizard Petton Everhail, descending into the catacomb of the Towne Cemetery to defeat the evil lich Nemesis and rescue his friend Grelminar.\n\nCatacomb 3-D is a landmark title in terms of first-person graphics. The game was released in November 1991 and is arguably the first example of the modern, character-based first-person shooter genre, or at least it was a direct ancestor to the games that popularized the genre. It was released for DOS with EGA graphics. The game introduced the concept of showing the player's hand in the three-dimensional viewpoint, and an enhanced version of its technology was later used for the more successful and well-known Wolfenstein 3D.",

They then trick the ship by ramming their own vehicle into it.

        "summary": "The final part of the trilogy makes the other two almost look like beta versions in comparison. To begin with, the story appears much less stereotypical than before. Three mythical sages seek to bring balance to the world by unleashing the power of an ancient magical artefact, the Jumarion. As they can't seize it themselves, they seek out the help of a mortal mage, who longed for the artifact all his life, and leaves a less than thrustworthy impression. Of all this the young knight Kaien knows nothing when he embarks on his pilgrimage. Rather he has to deal with a bunch of supersticious villainers and an alledgedly cursed little girl with a really strange personality...\n\nFor the first time the prerendered graphics are rather good-looking, though they still appear sterile. The combat system has also been improved greatly and now stands nothing short of the greatest of beat 'em up-esque ARPGs like Terranigma or Story of Thor. Magic has never been a strength of the Corum series. Now some of the spells actually come in form of special moves that have to be executed during combos, making their usage much more natural.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Kaien gathers a party of three characters overall. Rather than fighting at the same time at his side, they're available to the player to switch in between them during the game. It goes without saying that each of them comes with their individual strengths and weaknesses.\n\nUnusual for action RPGs, Corum III comes with a network version. The three playable characters would have suited well for cooperative play, but instead the game offers several arena modes, as well as a dungeon rush. It is a nice extra, but amounts to little more than a gimmick in the end.\n\nThe music is by far the best in the series as well. The game was originally released on three CDs, whith the last one entirely dedicated to the CD-audio sountrack. Did the first two games suffer from a rather small selection of songs available, Corum III got the right tune for every mood.\n\nAltogether, Corum III may be the best single player action RPG ever developed in Korea, and it was a loss for Germany that this was passed for a localization in favor of its still rather unpolished predecessor. This time Japan got more lucky, as Bothtec provided a translated version over there. The most funny and at the same time most sad thing is, Corum III actually made it to the US, yet hardly anyone ever got to play it there as the localization was handled by Gobe Software, then publisher of BeOS. Thus the game was only available for that not exactly widespread operating system.",

After leaving Sophie\u2019s hometown of Kirchen Bell, the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream, and as they get closer, a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege, and it\u2019s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly, when Sophie arrives at the atelier, she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta, and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend, she doesn\u2019t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues, Sophie meets aspiring alchemist, Ramizel Erlenmeyer, who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021\u2019s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.",

After leaving Sophie\u2019s hometown of Kirchen Bell, the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream, and as they get closer, a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege, and it\u2019s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly, when Sophie arrives at the atelier, she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta, and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend, she doesn\u2019t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues, Sophie meets aspiring alchemist, Ramizel Erlenmeyer, who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021\u2019s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.",

To do this you'll have to manage the water supply properly, make sure the city is policed well, and provide adequate education, entertainment, baths, and temples (which also hold your money and can be robbed if you don't have enough protection).\n\nAt some point, possibly more then once, you'll have to defend your province from invading tribes that don't really want you there. You also have to connect all the little villages in the province with roads and make some industry, like stone mining, grapes, etc. for which you can then create markets in your city.",

He inadvertently discovers the Orbital Frame, Jehuty, hidden. When he is attacked by BAHRAM forces who have come to seize it, Dingo climbs into Jehuty and engages the attackers, which include a female Orbital Frame runner named Ken Marinaris. During the battle, Dingo enters the BAHRAM battleship, seemingly defeating Nephtis, an Orbital Frame controlled by an AI program based on Viola's fighting style, but is subdued by Anubis, Jehuty's superior counterpart controlled by Col. Ridley \"Nohman\" Hardiman, leader of BAHRAM. Nohman requests Dingo to join him once again. When Dingo refuses as his comrades were sacrificed by Nohman years ago, Nohman shoots him and leaves him to die.",

The objective for both team is to hit a black puck with a hockey stick that each player carries into the opponent's goal. Teams are made up of five players including the goaltender, as opposed to six in real life. Players wear ice skates, which are used to skate across the icy arena. Each game is made up of three periods, with the victory going to the team who has the most points at the end of the game. At the beginning, two opposing players from each team face off in the middle of the rink. There are three kinds of players - the first is fast, weak, and feeble, but is good at the face-off; the second is average in all qualities, and the third is slow and poor at the face-off, but very powerful, both in body checking and shooting strength. The arena is similarly designed to a real-world ice hockey arena. The arena is coated in ice, with a goal on either side of the arena. There are a variety of marked areas, including the goal line that the puck must cross to score, the attacking / defending zone which is situated closely to each goal, the face-off spot, the neutral spot, and others. Each side of the arena has exactly the same design.

After leaving Sophie\u2019s hometown of Kirchen Bell, the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream, and as they get closer, a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege, and it\u2019s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly, when Sophie arrives at the atelier, she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta, and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend, she doesn\u2019t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues, Sophie meets aspiring alchemist, Ramizel Erlenmeyer, who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021\u2019s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.",

        "storyline": "The game takes place in the year 2172; mankind has colonized Earth's, Mars', and Jupiter's moons. A military force known as BAHRAM sends its primary offensive unit to attack Antilia, a Jupiter colony, in an attempt to secure two advanced machines known as Orbital Frames. One of the few colony survivors, a young boy named Leo Stenbuck, witnesses a falling Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicle (LEV) killing his friends. He flees to a hangar, where he finds an Orbital Frame by the name of Jehuty. Using this suit and its built-in intelligence, A.D.A, he fends off the BAHRAM forces led by officer Viola who seek to claim Jehuty on the orders of their leader, Nohman. Leo is then contacted by Elena Weinberg, the commander of the civilian transport vessel Atlantis; it belongs to Earth's military forces, the United Nations Space Force. As Jehuty's original pilot died during the attack, Elena requests Leo's assistance to deliver Jehuty back to them so they can take it to Mars. Leo, however, refuses to kill enemies.\n\nBattling through Antilia, Leo rescues civilians, including Celvice Klein, a friend; he defends the colony from destruction, defeating the BAHRAM forces and their commanders one by one. Before reaching Atlantis, Leo encounters Viola, who seeks a rematch; Leo defeats her, but is unwilling to kill her. Later, Atlantis pilot Rock Thunderheart meets Leo in person, revealing that BAHRAM forces are still determined to obtain Jehuty and are threatening to destroy the colony. Thunderheart requests Leo's help to pilot Jehuty, as he has realized Leo's skills are superior. Viola then appears, shooting Celvice this time, forcing Leo to fight again. Celvice is taken to the Thunderheart to be treated while Leo goes to save the colony.\n\nLeo goes to the docks and Viola battles him once more. However, Viola is defeated again and killed when a leftover bomb blows her out of the colony and into Jupiter's atmosphere. Nohman himself then appears in Jehuty's superior twin Frame Anubis, forcing Jehuty's escape. As Jehuty is docking, A.D.A. reveals to Leo its programming: when taken to the fortress Aumaan on Mars, the mechas is to eject its pilot and self-destruct Jehuty, destroying the frame and the fortress. Leo leaves Jehuty's cockpit and meets up with the crew of the Atlantis and Celvice, who survived her gunshot wound.",

Yuri interrupts the briefing to explain how he plans to take over the world, telling the American President Michael Dugan that he has a network of Psychic Dominators around the world, which he is now beginning to reveal. One of Yuri's Psychic Dominators is on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, which Yuri activates just before ending his transmission to the White House. The President immediately calls in an airstrike on the device, but all the attacking aircraft were shot down, although one crashes into the nuclear reactor on the island, causing the device to lose power and to not function. Despite this, Yuri activates his other Psychic Dominators around the world and the majority of the planet quickly succumbs to Yuri's mind-control.",

There were six annual versions of the game released, started with High Heat Baseball 1999, and ending with High Heat Major League Baseball 2004.\n\nThe game, featuring the official licensed team and player names from all 30 MLB teams, was created by games company 3DO which subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2003 soon after the release of the final version of the series, High Heat Major League Baseball 2004. In August 2003, Microsoft purchased the rights to the High Heat franchise from 3DO, however, Microsoft has yet to develop a new title in the series.\n\nHigh Heat was traditionally known for possessing more simulation-style qualities than competitors World Series Baseball, All Star Baseball, or Triple Play Baseball, but frequently lagged behind in graphical quality. At the core of High Heat\u2032s gameplay was its batter-pitcher interface, which was often hailed as the most realistic of its era.",

In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning the earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age. The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside. You are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised Underground. Having never ventured beyond your Metro Station-City limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to warn the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat. Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands above, where your actions will determine the fate of mankind.",
        "summary": "Metro 2033 is a first-person shooter with survival horror elements, based on the Russian book of the same name by Dmitry Glukhovsky. Most of the game takes place underground, but several times Artyom will have to venture outside, into the perpetual nuclear winter. Game progression is fairly linear, though areas may be explored more thoroughly for items and ammunition. Setpieces include a few on-rails sequences, missions that involve defending a location from an onslaught of monsters, and others. A few stages can be completed in a stealthy fashion.",

The gameplay is similar to the NES version of Side Pocket, although the player has less lives, the two-player mode does not have lives (although a 20-second time limit between shots is added), and of course, the game contains nudity. There is an English version of the game called Pocket Gal 2, which was released in 1989. Also in 1989, a version of the game was released titled Super Pool III. This version of the game does not contain nudity, and it was released in North America by I.Vics. A sequel to Pocket Gal was released in 1993 called Pocket Gal Deluxe. The gameplay of Pocket Gal Deluxe is similar to the Sega Genesis version of Side Pocket. In Pocket Gal Deluxe, the art style is much more realistic than Pocket Gal.\n\nEach of the 4 stages is hosted by a corresponding girl, who's only function (not that I'm complaining) is to strip when the level is cleared. Additional points and shots can be gained by pocketing balls in order, in computer-predetermined pockets, clearing special bonus tricks between stages, etc.",

After leaving Sophie\u2019s hometown of Kirchen Bell, the pair discovers a huge tree identical to one that Plachta had seen in a dream, and as they get closer, a mysterious vortex pulls them inside. Sophie awakens alone in a curious new world called Erde Wiege, and it\u2019s not long before she hears about an alchemist named Plachta that lives on the outskirts of town. Shockingly, when Sophie arrives at the atelier, she meets a young alchemy enthusiast named Plachta, and even though the alchemist shares the same name as her friend, she doesn\u2019t recognize Sophie. What other surprises await Sophie on this journey? As the adventure continues, Sophie meets aspiring alchemist, Ramizel Erlenmeyer, who willingly agrees to help her in her time of need. The narrative elegantly unfolds with a charming new visual style that combines the art of the Mysterious sub-series with the high-quality graphics and animations featured in 2021\u2019s Atelier Ryza 2: Lost Legends and the Secret Fairy.",

Eggman attempts an experiment using the Chaos Emeralds to perform the Chaos Control technique, but it goes awry and tears the world apart. This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy, Knuckles, and Cream, all of whom Eggman finds and captures, intending to create a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet. Sonic and Tails travel through the game's seven levels to recapture their friends and retrieve the Emeralds.\n\nThe final boss fight takes place at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple. Peace is restored to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and reprogramming it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.",
        "summary": "Sonic is back, and this time, he needs the help of all of his friends to defeat the evil Dr. Eggman. In Sonic Advance 3, Sonic and Tails must reunite with their friends Cream, Knuckles, and Amy. Team up with any of the five characters to gain special attack moves: Sonic increases your speed, Tails increases your jump power, Knuckles increases your attack power, Amy offers the Piko Piko hammer attack, and Cream lets you perform a homing attack. With a Game Boy Advance link, you and three of your friends can battle it out in multiplayer modes.",

        "storyline": "The Catacomb series, which includes Curse of the Catacombs and Terror of the Catacombs, is a set of first-person shooters that are notable for being developed from the original Catacomb which was designed by John Cormack, of Doom, Commander Keen and Wolfenstein fame. This is the fourth game in the series and plays out in similar fashion to the prequels and sequels but which remains an enjoyable enough entry. The game is a sort of cross between Gauntlet and Doom, with a fantasy style that sees the player taking the role of a magician who makes use of fireballs and spells rather than hi-tech weaponry. You are once again on the trail of the evil Nemesis and must free the townspeople from his reign of terror, which basically means venturing into a series of dungeons and blasting his minions into dust. Changes to the formula this time around include new environments which see you exploring areas beyond the previous games dungeons, including gardens, volcanoes and mines, and new enemies with some distinctive behaviour. The addition of a radar is also a neat touch and which requires the player to discover specific gems in order to reveal different kinds of monsters. Catacomb Abyss is a solid entry into the series, offering a few changes to the basic gameplay but nothing revolutionary. The combat remains fast, furious and uncomplicated and there are plenty of thrilling moments to be experienced. The graphics are decent enough in that old-school fashion, with big, bold sprites and varied environments which present plenty of opportunities for exploration. If you're looking for an enjoyable shooter then this certainly delivers, but its lack of depth and variety soon become obvious and its appeal wanes quickly.",

Spider-Man is then seen chasing Sandman through New York City. They engage in combat and Sandman is defeated, just before Rhino throws a car at Spider-Man, who avoids it. Rhino manages to escape and then the Triskelion can be seen in flames. It is later revealed that the fire was caused by an explosion, which let all super-villains free from the prison, along with symbiotes created from a mixture of the venom suit and OZ formula. Throughout the game, Spider-Man has to fight several villains which appear in Ultimate Spider-Man comics, such as Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino. Many of the villains' followers have to be fought as well, like symbiotes, thugs and goblins.\n\nAfter fighting Electro, the police talks to Spider-Man, saying that if he keeps fighting villains, they would have to send Roxxon security robots to get him, as they have the situation under control. After fighting Venom twice and facing a symbiote army, Spider-Man is informed by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that Norman Osborne (Green Goblin) has captured some baseball players, as well as the mayor and threatened to transform them into goblins unless the whole city is given to him. Spider-Man fights Doctor Octopus and then heads to the stadium, where he finds Green Goblin, who escapes. After chasing Norman through Manhattan, Spider-Man fights and defeats him. After defeated Green Goblin is taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who thank Spider-Man for his help and informs him that Dr. Connors (Lizard) had been working to create an antidote for the symbiotes left in the city.\n\nAt the end of the game, Spider-Man is sitting on a bench, when the woman which appears in the beginning of the game, comes to him and says he is not a freak after all, before photographing the two of them with her phone. Spider-Man tells her that he would appreciate if she did not upload the photograph to the internet, and then goes away.",

        "storyline": "In the late 22nd century, humans have colonized Mars, and also set up a few colonies in Jupiter's orbit. Giant robots known as Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicles (L.E.V.) have helped them to achieve this lofty goal. However, as time passed, the inhabitants of the Earth started to treat the space colonists, whom they called \"Enders\", with suspicion, subjecting them to harsh laws and repercussions. Eventually, some of the colonists founded rebel organizations, armed with particularly powerful mechas called Orbital Frames. A young colonist from Jupiter, Leo Stenbuck, unexpectedly comes into contact with an Orbital Frame named Jehuty. A terrible power is in his hands - will he use it for good, or for evil?..",
        "summary": "Take control of a fully armed prototype mechanized robot and fight off enemies during a space colony hijack in Hideo Kojima's Zone of the Enders. In it, players become the character Leo Stenbuck, who sees the consequences of fighting first hand as he learns the true meaning of life and death. Combining state of the art PlayStation 2 graphics, tons of weapons, and an involving storyline, Zone of the Enders also provides a dynamically changing mission structure, a versus mode for two players, and a playable demo of Metal Gear Solid 2: Snake Eater in all first-run production copies.",

In place of the standard medieval fantasy world now stood a semi-science fiction / cyberpunk setting a la Final Fantasy 7. But not only did the scenario have nothing to do with the former games, the genre was also dropped in favor of a turn-based SRPG, to try and mimick the success of Softmax' The War of Genesis series, which HiCom was also publishing at the time.",

        "summary": "Super Drift Out: World Rally Championships is a 1995 rallying video game developed by Dragnet and published by Visco Corporation for the Super Famicom. It is the third game in the Drift Out series, and was followed by Neo Drift Out: New Technology; unlike the previous Drift Out '94: The Hard Order, it resembles the first Drift Out and is sometimes referred to as a port or remake for that reason.\n\nAll races in this video game are based on the 1994 World Rally Championship season. Two different types of background music ('normal' and 'hard' beats) and three racing levels (easy, normal, and hard) are available. The top six times are tracked in each of the rally legs; including the super special stage.\n\nA North American release was planned by Accolade, though it was never released. The North American version would have featured fake manufacturer names.",

The sprites are recoloured in a more vibrant cartoon-esque style, as opposed to the washed out effect from the games, to match the style of the Marvel vs Capcom series. If two players get Lou, then the second player's pallette is Green, and is most likely based on Siva's color clothing from the Midnight Wanderers game. Player two's firestorm is colored orange.\n\nLou's Companion Siva, has a character based on him as a tribute, featuring on Capcom's Cannon Spike game. The character is called Shiba Shintaro.",

There, he creates a time paradox which erases the dictator from history, and returns to his starting point.\n\nWith Nazi Germany removed from history, the Soviet Union is left unopposed as Joseph Stalin sees an opportunity to expand into Eastern Europe. In response, most of Europe ally against this new threat, and start a desperate war against the new aggressor.",

Spies lurk, landmines await, and strange new technologies aid both sides in the struggle for ultimate control.

There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually won\u2019t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, you\u2019ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.\n\nNinja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.\n\nThe levels (called \u201cscenes\u201d in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels you\u2019ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.",

A fact not that easy to understand when having a try at the series' first entry, as it feels quite unpolished.\n\nThe story about a warrior that seeks revenge on the evil lord that has slaughtered his entire village is a beaten horse, but where the game falls flat the most is its action battle system. There's a severe lack of variety, as the hero only knows no offensive moves other than a standard combo and a dash attack. A block button is supposed to bring more depth to the fighting, but it puts the player in a worse situation more often than not, so a combination of evasion and button mashing is always more effective, the incredibly stupid AI takes care of the rest. Even the bosses seem ridiculously easy at first, that is until they switch into near-invincible mode, which requires hours of grinding to even be able to touch them at this state. There are also only three different weapon types, swords, halberds and (utterly useless) bows. Funny enough, there is a bar that recharges in between attacks and determines the strength of the next stroke, much like in Final Fantasy Adventure on the classic Game Boy.",

Unlike its prequel, the game is now centered on action elements with the player not needing to protect civilians in need and instead Jehuty contains more weaponry than in the previous game.\n\nThe plot is set two years after the events from Zone of the Enders and focuses on Dingo Egret, a former member from Mars' military organization BAHRAM whose leader Ridley \"Nohman\" Hardiman wants back with him. Nohman shoots Dingo following his rejection but the agent Ken Marinaris saves Dingo by connecting his body to Jehuty and forces to work in order to defeat BAHRAM. The game had a new director, Shuyo Murata, who producer Hideo Kojima appointed in order to provide a different experience. The team worked to cover the criticism the original Zone of the Enders received resulted in The 2nd Runner having more action elements.\n\nThe game received generally favorable critical response due to the improvements it has in comparison to the previous game. Critics praised the game's graphics and gameplay elements but criticized its short length and presentation. Despite the positive critical reaction, the game suffered mediocre sales. In 2012, The 2nd Runner was released in PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as a part of the Zone of the Enders HD Collection.",

        "summary": "This is an arcade-style rallying game with a particular isometric view. To start, players chooses between three big Japanese rally-spec vehicles\u2014the Mitsubishi Lancer, the Subaru Impreza, and the Toyota Celica\u2014which vary in their Speed, Control, and Body stats. \n \nIn each racing stage, the player needs to get to the finish line in the shortest time possible. If the clock hits zero, the player loses and the game is over unless they can continue. While driving, the time is hindered by barrels, puddles, slippery ice, cones and other obstacles in the player's path. Even other cars driving can be an obstacle. Also the player has to keep straight when driving up slopes, or the car will swerve and crash. The player can gain more time if they make it through checkpoints in between the starting and finishing points. The player can also take shortcuts. Before making a turn, the player will always get an immediate warning on the screen with a voice saying which direction the player ought to turn and certain warnings. \n \nAside from the starting Practice stage, there are six other stages to be conquered: European, African, Snow Land, Southern Hemisphere, Scandinavian, and Great Britain.",

The station-cities of the Metro struggle for power using weapons found in D6. The player follows Artyom, the main protagonist from Metro 2033, as he searches for the mysterious \"Prisoner\", the supposed \u201ckey to survival \u2013 the last light in our darkest hour\u2026\u201d",
        "summary": "Based on the Russian novel Metro 2033 by Dmitry Glukhovsky, Metro: Last Light is a post-apocalyptic horror first-person shooter that serves as a new chapter in the Metro saga and is the sequel to Metro 2033. Like its predecessor, the game is a primarily story-driven shooter with heavy stealth elements. Artyom may carry up to three weapons at a time, however bullets are scarce and valuable to the point that higher grade bullets are, in fact, the Metro's currency. When dealing with armed opponents, stealth is encouraged and it is wise to save ammunition for the many mutant creatures encountered in combat. In many situations the player can choose between straightforward shooting and stealth, also having the option for lethal or non-lethal enemy takedowns.",

This time however, he has kidnapped Tails and Knuckles too. Learning of his friends' kidnapping, Sonic rushes off to save them. Along the way, Sonic saves a young rabbit named Cream and her Chao friend, Cheese, from Eggman after defeating his EggHammerTankII. Cream then joins Sonic on his adventure to find her missing mother, Vanilla.\n\nSonic soon rescues Tails from Eggman too, although Tails has no idea what Eggman is up to, and Tails joins Sonic on his mission. When Sonic finds Knuckles, the echidna has been tricked by Eggman into fighting Sonic. After being defeated and chided by Sonic, Knuckles comes with him to get back at Eggman. The heroes eventually track Eggman to his Egg Utopia space station, which they destroy, and Cream finds Vanilla in the aftermath, unharmed.",

On this occasion, Sonic is joined by friends Tails, Knuckles and Cream the Rabbit, the latest addition to the Sonic team. Each comes with a set of unique moves, allowing you to reach certain areas through-out the levels. However, unlike Sonic Advance, you must complete the game as Sonic to unlock the other characters.\n\nChaos Emeralds and Special Rings litter the stages. To collect the emeralds (transforming Sonic into Super Sonic for the final battle with Dr. Eggman), you must find the special rings hidden in each stage to unlock the bonus stage. Complete the bonus stage and the emerald is yours.\n\nYou'll also get the chance to collect and raise chaos, and trade them over to Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on GameCube, through the use of the GBA/GC link cable.",

Birds sing their songs with the morning sun,\nand the light shines upon flowers growing along the roads.\n\nThe atmosphere on the edge of town is warm and gentle.\nThe sunlight filtering through trees spreads out like a tapestry of light and shade down a single path.\nIt leads to a small house where a girl lives.\n\nShe's cheerful and bright, though somewhat absentminded.\nAn ordinary girl you might find anywhere.\nHowever, she possesses one special power that the townspeople do not have.\n\nThe mysterious power to mix several materials and create something entirely different: \"Alchemy\"...\n\nUnfortunately, she continues to fail at an essential skill, Synthesis.\nShe reaches her limit, with no alchemy books to read, and no mentor to guide her.\n\nBut one day, the girl encounters a mysterious book that can move and talk on its own accord.\nThe book claims to be the \"knowledge\" of alchemy itself.\nThis meeting between a book and a young alchemist will become a quiet, yet certain, step forward.\"",
        "summary": "Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book is an upcoming Japanese role-playing video game. It is the 17th main game in the \"Atelier\" series.\n\nThe game features a completely reformed world view from earlier titles within the series, in addition to a new alchemy-centric system. Sophie is able to obtain ideas for recipes from activities such as harvesting, exploring, battling, or from events, and these ideas are used as a basis of improving her knowledge of alchemy.\n\nWhen she performs alchemy, the player is presented with various predetermined shapes representing the ingredients used, and arranges each shape on a puzzle board that represents the cauldron. This process involves visual trial-and-error, and if the shapes are arranged perfectly, the player receives a bonus. The materials selected affect the quality of the item synthesized. This system is intended to offer a high degree of freedom based on the player's own play style.",

        "summary": "Dungeon Master established several new standards for role playing and computer games in general. Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. Abstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them.\n\nIt also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.",

The game features four playable characters; Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy. Each character has the same moveset as they did in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Sonic & Knuckles, with the addition of a melee attack. Each character has a special ability, such as Sonic's splice shield, Tails' flight and Knuckles' gliding and climbing abilities. In her playable 2D debut, Amy cannot perform the Spin Dash or get into ball form when jumping like the others, and must rely on her Piko Piko Hammer to defend herself, making her unique amongst the characters. Grind rails first introduced in Sonic Adventure 2 also make their first 2D appearance. Sonic and Tails can also be used at the same time during the story by inputting a cheat code at the character selection screen. When playing as both characters, the gameplay is similar to that of Sonic the Hedgehog 2: The player can only control Sonic and a CPU-controlled Tails follows him.",
        "summary": "Sonic Advance is notable for being the first Sonic game released on a Nintendo console, despite both Sega and Nintendo being well-known rivals on the console market throught the 1990s.\n\nSonic Advance features four playable characters and marks the first playable appearance of Amy Rose on a 2D title. The game borrows elements from the original Sonic the Hedgehog titles for the Sega Genesis, but with the post-Dreamcast artstyle for the characters which was introduced in Sonic Adventure. The game also includes multiplayer features and mini-games.\n\nThe title was also ported to the Nokia N-Gage under the title \"SonicN\".",

        "summary": "Sonic Advance Revamped is a remake and reimagining of the original Sonic Advance on the GBA using the Sonic Worlds Delta engine; it's a passion project designed to be the definitive way to play Sonic Advance, with better hazard placement, a 16:9 aspect ratio, patched-up levels and bosses, completely redesigned Special Stages, the smoothest sprites from each GBA Sonic title (with some special cases and custom sprites here and there), re-implemented unused/beta elements, and true classic Sonic controls to make the game feel even better. Features set for the future include an exclusive Team Chaotix Mission Mode, 8 Unique Playable Main Characters (7 of which are playable in this Demo), a fleshed-out Tiny Chao Garden, New Levels and Music Tracks, and more! For this particular Demo, Sonic's Insta-Shield is swapped-out for his Drop Dash! This move will be an early unlockable in the final version.",

Here, it is the regular, classic \"Amazing\" Spider-Man, and Spider-Man 2099 \u2013 in a story awash in time travel, temporal battles, and Anti-Venom.\n\nThe backbone of this story seems to play out more like a Spider-Man 2099 story, since he is the only character truly aware of the happenings in the game, and the changes that both Spider-Men encounter. From the opening, things are bleak for Amazing Spider-Man who begins the game nearly dead, and 2099 is the only one who can help. A new villain Walker Sloan enters the picture with a plan to rebuild the past (from the year 2099) in his image and design, which turns to affect both Spider-Men. From this point, chaos unfolds in typical comic-book fashion with gameplay evenly split between Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2099, with every other level interwoven with the events of one Spidey to the other.",

Boasting eleven different modes of play, HH 2004 takes several steps beyond the product offered last year and genuinely tries rather hard to push feature diversity. All the classics are here: Home Run Derby, Exhibition, All-Star Games, Batting Practice, Player Editing devices, and other such goodies await the gamers who patiently explore its every area. Perfect for two-player matches, Two-on-Two Showdown returns from last year's PS2 version and presents itself as a console-exclusive option (you're not going to find it in the GBA or PC versions at all).",

On levels whose lower two digits are 99 and on level 998, the level will only increase when a line is cleared. As the level increases, so too does the speed at which blocks fall, until eventually they reach the bottom of the playing field instantaneously, a state referred to as 20G. Once the pieces have hit 20G, the player has only a fraction of a second to maneuver them into the desired position before they are locked into place.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to receive a high ranking, which is based entirely on score. The highest ranking of the game is Grand Master, which only occurs when a specified rank is reached within a determined time threshold. In the case that two players have achieved the exact same score, the high score table will award a higher place to the one who attained that score faster.",
        "summary": "The first entry in the Tetris: The Grand Master sub-series, this game plays similarly to other Tetris games, but rather than merely expecting the player to survive indefinitely, it challenges the player to attain the highest level and score they can in the shortest amount of time. The Grand Master series introduced several play mechanics to Tetris gameplay which can be seen today in its sequels and many other Tetris implementations.",

Beat the game once and then be curious \"What if I would do it differently\". Sometimes it's something small but from time to time you'll see huge differences. The smallest things can be most rewarding.\n\nDARK, SAD AND DISTURBING WORLD: Visit the place known from the previous chapters of the Bad Dream Series.

        "summary": "Based on the Fox cartoon series of the same name, NASCAR RACERS is a glimpse of what NASCAR will be like in the future. You can choose from five different cars, each with its own abilities that increase during the course of the race including one car that becomes invincible and another that gains a huge burst of speed. After you choose the correct car for your driving style, hit one of the 20 tracks available in the game. While you're on the track, you need to keep an eye out for the oil slicks, water puddles, and random debris that will slow down or damage your car. If the car sustains too much damage, then the race is over, for you anyway. Luckily, there is a truck to refuel and repair your vehicle. Will you be able to cross the finish line in NASCAR RACERS?\n\nIt was published in 2000 for Microsoft Windows and Game Boy Color by Hasbro and developed by Software Creations (PC) and Digital Eclipse (GBC). A PlayStation version was planned but cancelled before release.",

In Red Alert 3 the Soviet leadership, facing defeat, goes back in time to kill Albert Einstein and prevent his assistance to the allies, paving the way for Soviet domination in the present. However, as an unintended consequence, a third world power, the Empire of the Rising Sun, is created and all three sides go to war.",

        "summary": "Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend (released in Japan as Side Pocket 2) is a pocket billiards video game for the Sega Genesis and Sega Saturn, featuring famed billiards player Rudolf \"Minnesota Fats\" Wanderone. It was released as a sequel to Data East's earlier success, Side Pocket. The objective is to travel through different cities and defeat AI-controlled hustlers. The player can also take on another human player in order to prove his worthiness at the pool table.\n\nThe player can participate in a story mode and play against a set of pros in six different pool halls in an attempt to face off against Minnesota Fats himself. There are seven different variations of pool to play: Eight-Ball, Nine-Ball, Rotation, 14-1 rack, Three ball, Cut Throat & One Pocket. There is also a Versus Mode to let players take on any opponent of their choice including a two-player option to take on a friend and a Tournament Mode. Players can also try out the Trick Mode that has the player try to compete 16 different trick shots.\n\nThe Saturn version of the game largely plays the same as the Genesis version, but includes a training mode, a short documentary on Minnesota Fats, and a completely different plot in the story mode. In the Genesis version, the player takes the role of an unnamed rookie pool player seeking to challenge Minnesota Fats, and cutscenes are computer-animation. In the Saturn version, the player takes the role of Minnesota Fats himself, in his quest to challenge fictional pool hustlers from around the United States; live-action, full-motion videos (FMVs) are used for the cutscenes.\n\nIn Japan, the title Side Pocket 2 is only used in the Saturn version, whereas the Genesis version retains the Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend title.",

The players could also shoot powerups that grants him a weapon or a life. The weapon is lost if the player is hit, but not if he shoots a civilian. Virtua Cop was notable for its use of polygonal graphics, which were subsequently used in both House of the Dead and Time Crisis, instead of the two dimensional sprites that were popular for previous games in the same genre. It is also notable for being one of the first games to allow the player to shoot through glass. Its name derived from this graphical style, which was previously used in Virtua Fighter, Virtua Striker and Virtua Racing.",

Three of its leaders, King, Boss, and Kong are all in the maximum security federal pen. And the final, fourth member of the E.V.I.L Inc. gang, international terrorist Joe Fang is believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash, though his body was never found. After the downfall of E.V.I.L Inc., a comprehensive investigation of their black market and gun-running activities was launched in the Virtua City bank.\nLast year it looked as though the Virtua Squad had finally put an end to the E.V.I.L Syndicate\u2019s reign of crime over Virtua City. The gangleaders were all either behind bars, in intensive care, or under 6 feet of dirt. And the Virtua City Police Special Investigations Unit got a new member in the shape of Janet Marshall, an expert in criminal psychology profiling.\nThen trouble started brewing in unlikely places.... The vice-president of the Virtua City Bank was killed in shady circumstances that were only officially termed \"accidental\". And the swollen accounts of the now-defunct E.V.I.L Syndicate, which he had been suspected of laundering, were emptied overnight. The missing funds amounted to more than the GNP of most small countries.\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town, alarms break the quiet and calm of the Virtua City air. A daring daylight raid on the biggest jeweler\u2019s in the state! And at the site of the new subway construction, there\u2019s been an unusual amount of unexplained activity involving some very suspicious-looking materiel. Looks like the E.V.I.L is reborn.",

The level system has been expanded in many forms with increasingly stricter requirements to reach the Grand Master rank. Modes include Easy, Sakura (a puzzle mode also seen in Tetris With Cardcaptor Sakura: Eternal Heart), the traditional Master mode, and Shirase (an extension of T.A. Death with even harsher speed, garbage, and levels beyond 999). It also features World and Classic Rules, the former added by Arika due to The Tetris Company's recent policy changes.",

Delighted that she is able to see him, Lili grants Kahoko a magical violin, and a place in the school's annual musical competition, which many students in the music department vie to partake in.\n\nKahoko refuses, only to be pressed on by the fairy, who constantly nags her until she finally gives way to his pleads. She reluctantly accepts the instrument. As she practices her pieces, Kahoko is amazed that she can play any piece on the violin as long as she knows the tune and plays it with her heart.",

The last official patch (2.0e) came out in January 2004. Since then Savage: The Battle for Newerth has been continuously improved by the Savage community: from 2004 to 2005 by the EX2 team, from 2005 to 2007 by the SEP/SFE team and since 2008 by the Savage XR team.\n\nAlthough the game has been criticized for being released in an unpolished state, lacking basic features and any kind of tutorials, Savage: The Battle for Newerth with its innovative RTS/FPS gameplay was far ahead of its time, winning awards such as the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Technical Excellence and the Audience Award at the Independent Games Festival 2004 or the Editor's Choice Award \"8.7 - Great\" by IGN.com.",

It was the final cricket game in the series to be developed by Melbourne House.\n\nCompared to the previous game, the improvement in graphics continued with three-dimensional stadiums (though players remained rendered as sprites). Cricketing legends Ritchie Benaud and Ian Botham for the first time provided commentary and also featured in full motion video interludes. The game did not feature real player names as with previous games in the series (with real Australian and English sides appearing for the first time in the game's successor, Ashes Tour Edition).",

Along the way you will encounter and have to battle old foes like Rhino, Mysterio, Puma, Doc Ock and more. The game interface consists of a simple point and click system coupled with keyboard movement. Unlike it's console counterpart there is no free swinging movement but one designed with kids in mind.\n\nFighting consists of basic punching, kicking, jumpkicks and a power meter that let's you do a supercharged attack. 'Spidey' can also zip to walls and objects and use his web to do basic attacks on enemies.",

Once the house is built, you have to get Fred a car so that he can get to the quarry to work, thus earning enough money to hire a dino crane to put the roof on. Progress is measured by points, these are gained as you build the house, get to work and finally find Wilma.",

        "summary": "Warau Warawau (Laughing Warawau) is a freeware story-heavy adventure/RPG made in RPG Maker 2000.\n\nWarau Warawau is a spin-off game in the Towelket series, mixing characters and stories from the mainline series with popular fiction, most noticeably Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. There is some turn-based combat like in the mainline series and the game takes you to many exotic, surreal and sometimes disturbing places. Warau Warawau became a cult hit and is still popular among Japanese fans.\n\nThis is the first game to not use a mix of public domain music (classic, jazz, ragtime etc.), but instead it features the free music by Hirokazu Akiyama, whose music was also used in other RPG Maker games/series like Alicemare.",

U.S. Forces engaged in police action and reconnaissance operations to protect RDO interests from Czervenian incursion and local Red Coin terrorist factions. U.S. Army forces moved on a secret Czervenian fortified hideout, designated \"Ranch\", discovered on the Ostregal mainland, stopping Czervenia from coordinating surface-to-air attacks against Coalition aircraft and allowing incoming humanitarian relief to reach thousands of displaced refugees. A Long Range Reconnaissance team conducted a recon mission to determine Czervenian force strength at a possible staging area on the Ostregal island of Palisav and collected vital photographic evidence about a probable and dire threat, details of which are currently classified. With the arrival of U.S. and Coalition Forces, the Czervenian Army was driven off the Ostregal mainland. They made a hasty retreat over the CZ Transocean Highway, across the Silent Harbor Bridge and over the border on Palisav Island. The bridge became a strategic lightning rod for ongoing clashes with Czervenian troops and their allies, so called Red Coin terrorists.",

        "summary": "Dungeon Master established several new standards for role playing and computer games in general. Dungeon Master was a realtime game instead of the traditional turn-based approach that was prevalent until then. Instead of using text-based commands to interact with the environment, players directly manipulated objects and the environment by clicking the mouse in the enlarged first-person view. \n \nAbstract Dungeons and Dragons style experience points and levels were eschewed in favor of a system where the characters' skills were improved directly via using them. It also introduced some novel control methods including the spell casting system, which involved learning sequences of runes which represented the form and function of a spell's effect. For example, a fireball spell was created by mixing the fire symbol with the wing symbol. This kind of attention to detail and focus on the user interface was typical of the game and helped create an often captivating sense of craft and ingenuity. Other factors in immersiveness were the then-revolutionary use of sound effects to indicate when a creature was nearby, and (primitive) dynamic lighting.",

A military force known as BAHRAM sends its primary offensive unit to attack Antilia, a Jupiter colony, in an attempt to secure two advanced machines known as Orbital Frames. One of the few colony survivors, a young boy named Leo Stenbuck, witnesses a falling Laborious Extra-Orbital Vehicle (LEV) killing his friends. He flees to a hangar, where he finds an Orbital Frame by the name of Jehuty. Using this suit and its built-in intelligence, A.D.A, he fends off the BAHRAM forces led by officer Viola who seek to claim Jehuty on the orders of their leader, Nohman. Leo is then contacted by Elena Weinberg, the commander of the civilian transport vessel Atlantis; it belongs to Earth's military forces, the United Nations Space Force. As Jehuty's original pilot died during the attack, Elena requests Leo's assistance to deliver Jehuty back to them so they can take it to Mars. Leo, however, refuses to kill enemies.\n\nZone of the Enders: 2nd Runner:\nThe game is set in the year 2174, two years after the events of Zone of the Enders. It follows Dingo Egret, a miner working on Callisto. He inadvertently discovers the Orbital Frame, Jehuty, hidden. When he is attacked by BAHRAM forces who have come to seize it, Dingo climbs into Jehuty and engages the attackers, which include a female Orbital Frame runner named Ken Marinaris.[6] During the battle, Dingo enters the BAHRAM battleship, seemingly defeating Nephtis, an Orbital Frame controlled by an AI program based on Viola's fighting style, but is subdued by Anubis, Jehuty's superior counterpart controlled by Col. Ridley \"Nohman\" Hardiman, leader of BAHRAM. Nohman requests Dingo to join him once again. When Dingo refuses as his comrades were sacrificed by Nohman years ago, Nohman shoots him and leaves him to die.",

He soon becomes obsessed with proving that other human survivors exist outside of Moscow and makes numerous dangerous expeditions to the surface, much to Anna's concern and Miller's frustration. However, on one such expedition with Anna, they witness a working train running on the surface. Before they can follow it, they are captured by Hansa soldiers, along with a group of people who claim to be from outside of Moscow. The Hansa soldiers execute the other prisoners, and Artyom is shot and left for dead, taking Anna to their base. Surviving the gunshot, Artyom follows the soldiers to rescue Anna, and in the process inadvertently destroys a signal jammer that was blocking all communications going in and out of Moscow. Radio transmissions from all over the world begin to be picked up, and Artyom and Anna realise humanity has not gone extinct. They escape by stealing one of Hansa's locomotives, the \"Aurora\", with the aid of a defected Hansa train engineer called Yermak.\n\nAs the train leaves, the Spartan Order moves in to retake it and are shocked and confused at Artyom and Anna's presence. Knowing that Hansa will have all of them put to death for knowing the truth, Miller concludes that the Spartans' best chance of survival is to flee Moscow. Once outside the city, he reveals to the others that while many of Russia's cities were bombed, the war did not end and NATO proceeded to occupy what was left of the nation. To prevent NATO from attacking Moscow, the Russian leadership decided to secretly jam all communications to make the outside world believe nobody had survived. They then receive a radio broadcast from Moscow Defense Command calling for survivors to rally at the \"Ark\", located at Mount Yamantau. Miller decides to head there, believing that the Ark is where the Russian government has rebuilt itself.\n\nAfter crossing the cult-controlled Volga River, the Spartans reach the Yamantau base. They discover the base's service and construction crew have devolved into cannibals who lure survivors in with the false promise of safety. Artyom and the Spartans manage to fight their way out and escape, but Miller's faith in Russia is shattered when he discovers that the government never took refuge in Yamantau, nor survived the war, and thus the Spartans are left wondering what to do next. Using a map they recovered from Yamantau, they decide to travel to a satellite communication center near the Caspian Sea in the hopes of gaining access to a satellite to find habitable land to settle. At the dried up remains of the Caspian Sea, the Spartans steal water and fuel from the local bandits while obtaining an updated satellite map.\n\nAs the Spartans continue on their journey, Anna begins to cough up blood, fearing the cause was accidentally breathing poison gas during the journey. They decide to scout a nearby taiga forest valley to see if it is suitable to settle. While scouting the forest, Artyom is caught between two rival survivor factions, and he discovers that the dam protecting the valley from radiation is on the verge of failing, making the area uninhabitable. Artyom returns to the train to learn Anna's condition has worsened. The Spartans detour to the heavily-irradiated city of Novosibirsk, the closest location where an antidote may be found.\n\nMiller and Artyom decide to head into the city alone to search for the antidote despite the risk. They enter the Novosibirsk Metro and find a young boy named Kirill, one of the last of the Novosibirsk survivors, who explains that his father left on a mission to obtain a map marking the location of a clean, habitable area. Miller and Artyom split up, with Miller going to find the map and Artyom searching for the antidote. He manages to recover the antidote, but is gravely wounded by a mutant and absorbs a heavy dose of radiation. Artyom, Miller, and Kirill return to the train with the map and the antidote, but Miller dies of radiation poisoning on the way back after using a dose of anti-radiation serum meant for himself to save Artyom. The rest of the Spartans donate their own blood to give Artyom a critical blood transfusion. Anna is cured with the antidote and with the map, the Spartans settle on the shores of Lake Baikal, which is completely free from radiation.\n\nArtyom's ultimate fate depends on the choices the player made during the journey; In the bad ending, Artyom dies from the radiation poisoning, and the Spartans and a grieving Anna hold a funeral for him and Miller while Artyom's and Miller's spirits awaken on a dilapidated version of the Aurora, remaining in the ghostly purgatory for eternity. In the good ending, Artyom survives. Miller is buried and Artyom is selected to take his place as leader of the Spartan Order. Now with a home free from radiation, Artyom decides to return to Moscow and reveal the truth of the world to the survivors of the Metro.",

        "summary": "NCAA Football GameBreaker is a heartbreaking near-miss. While the options are fantastic and the graphics are gorgeous, the playbook is a layperson's nightmare - and game control is extremely frustrating. College football fans just shouldn't have to come so close, yet still be so far.... \n \nFirst, the good news: GameBreaker will be a treat for college football fans, whose games usually play second-fiddle to the bigger, badder NFL slamfests. GameBreaker runs on the new, improved GameDay engine, and has the options and small touches to bring out the school spirit in anyone. Then there's all those teams, displayed in fantastic motion-captured graphics. And let's not forget the abundant animation capped off with excellent pep band music and an echoing announcer's voice. In short, this game is simply gorgeous. It's easily the best-looking college football game anywhere. \n \nWait, sit back down. \n \nGameBreaker is knocked out of the game thanks to its atrocious playbook interface. There's little doubt the designers meant well when they compiled the mother lode of all playbooks. But the options are so numerous (and so spread out) that it's far too difficult to find the right play for the right situation. Even the special teams section is hidden, meaning there's no choice but to cycle through the entire menu to find it. With seconds left and no time outs, the last thing anyone wants to do is peruse the playbook. Simple features could have made play selection so much easier: For example, on fourth down, the special teams box could (and should) have been front and center. And if that isn't enough.... \n \nGameBreaker's got a tough one-player game - one so hard that even an experienced thumb-back can end up losing to the worst teams on the easiest level. This fact is largely attributable to the computer's ability to instantly find the perfect play and perfectly execute it (complete with precisely-timed stiff-arms). This may present a great challenge for the experienced, but players new to console football won't enjoy it at all...and with four difficulty settings to choose from, this is inexcusable. \n \nThis all adds up to put college football fans in a tough spot: There're plenty of frills, but no gameplay. College football freaks will enjoy this game despite the tough interface and gameplay. But first-timers (and NFL mavens used to the easy handling of GameDay, Quarterback Club, and even Madden) won't like what they find. Simply put, this game's not ready for the big leagues. --Hugh Sterbakov \n--Copyright \u00a91999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Lights out!\n\n\u201cMetro 2033: Wars\u201d is a turn-based, open-world, strategy game, based on the story of Dmitry Glukhovsky's best-selling novel series, \u201cMetro 2033.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the year 2033 and the entirety of the world has been reduced to nuclear rubble. Humanity is nearing extinction and radiation is making even the most basic surface dwelling, uninhabitable. New life forms have arisen that are far better adapted to this new dark, damp and alien-like world. Bands of survivors live on without ever knowing the warmth of sunlight, and whether or not they are the last ones left on Earth. The Moscow Metro is the reluctant home for this new humanity and one you protect at all costs.\n\nMetro Stations have become city-states run by new and emerging Factions, uniting its members around ideas, religions, water, or simply the need to survive. Your daily existence centers around gathering resources necessary for survival, repelling attacks of mutants, exploring and conquering new metro stations and developing armed mercenary units when the need arises. To survive, you'll have to build necessary facilities at Stations, establish diplomatic relations with your neighbors and uphold the economy of your little underground state.",

In this case, it's JPBA member, Kyoko Sone.\n\nUnlike the prior installments in the Side Pocket series, Side Pocket 3 renders the pool room environment with 3D polygons. In spite of this, the table can still be viewed in a traditional, top-down fashion.\n\nPlay modes consist of: story mode, training mode, trick game mode, and versus mode. Game variants include: eight ball, nine ball, rotation, 14.1 continuous, bowlliards, cutthroat, three ball, poker, pocket game, mitsudama, and yotsudama.",

This entire setting is set in a theme park-style arena called Gallop Racing Square. \n \nNot only can players create their own horses, but they can also race classic and legendary horses from previous years in the history of horse racing. The gameplay is virtually the same as previous versions, pressing buttons at a certain point in time to urge the horse while racing, with several gauges to monitor such as the horses stamina, their position in the race as well as their mental condition. Players can also bet in races, with a true feel of betting simulation, figuring in weather conditions, the horses conditions as well as the horses stats.",
